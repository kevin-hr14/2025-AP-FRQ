Introduction
This repository contains my solutions and reflections for the AP Computer Science exam taken on 05/07/2025. While reviewing the released questions, I've documented my approach, insights gained, and areas for future growth.

Exam Experience
In this section, I reflect on my overall experience taking the AP Computer Science exam:

My preparation strategy for the exam included practicing text book, review previous FRQ, and take times did some mock exam by myself.

The most challenging aspects of the exam were TIME CONSUMING and right comprehension the FRQ.

Time management techniques that worked well for me is that make sure finish the question you understand first, hard question if have times left then give a shoot, otherwise picke the one you fell more reasonable.

Mental strategies I used when encountering difficult questions in MC, try to separated the codes to different part that you can easily understand and don't fell stress if not many times leave, then base on your experience choose a reasonable choise. Other case (FRQ), don't be afraid if something have an error or suspect your work, more change more wrong expect you 100% sure that there is a mistake, even you make a mistake that just a partial grade doesn't effect your grade too much. 

Growth Opportunities
Through this review process, I've identified these areas for continued learning which is deal with multiple classes, because it need very careful to void overridden.

Topic/Concept 1: deal a multiple class contain ArrayList, Array, Scanner, and all the looping stuff.
Topic/Concept 2: create a little switch methed inside the classes.
Programming practice: Create a randomly roulette class wich had every character's detail in Honkai: Star Rail.

Resources
Resources I found helpful during my exam preparation and review:

AP Computer Science A Past Exam Questions https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a/exam/past-exam-questions // don't try to cheat with this link, the only reason i bring to here is a opportunity that praticing more questions.

Future Goals
Moving forward, I plan to learning mechanical engineering and CS, probably also electrical enginneing. Those major will combine to a final form (major): mechatronic engineering.

[Specific goal related to computer science learning]:C++, STM32 or Arduino
[Project idea inspired by the exam content]:Chess game simulator
[Study strategy for future computer science courses]:try to code every week, write down the idea that might code in program.
